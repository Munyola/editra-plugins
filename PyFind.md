# Introduction #

This page includes information about the PyFind component of the PyStudio plugin. PyFind is a shelf window that provides the functionality to search for and find python modules that are on the PYTHONPATH of the current file that is open for editing in Editra.

# Details #

The screenshot below shows what the PyFind window looks like.

  * The first button on the left gives access to the PyStudio configuration dialog. There are currently no configuration options specific to the PyFind component. See the general configuration on the PyStudio main page for information about configuring the Python installation for the development environment to use.
  * The text field near the right edge of the window is a free form text field for entering the module name you wish to search for. The enter key can be used to initiate a search.
  * The Find button on the far right will start a search job for the module name entered in the text field.

# Usage #

Once a search is complete the results will be shown in the list. Double clicking on any of the results in the list will open that file in the editor.
