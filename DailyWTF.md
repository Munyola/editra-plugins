# Introduction #

TheDailyWTF plugin adds an item to the editor buffers context menu to allow you to submit the selected piece snippet of code in the editor to [theDailyWTF.com](http://thedailywtf.com).

This plugin was created just for fun in response to the October 27, 2010 article http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Submit-WTF-Code-Directly-From-Your-IDE.aspx

This plugin is compatible with Editra > 0.5.86

# Usage #

To use the plugin it must have first been enabled in the PluginManager dialog. Then simply select the snippet of "interesting" code that you have found in the editor that may have had you think "WTF?!".
